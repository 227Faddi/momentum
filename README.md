## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Tailwind, React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, JWT.

## Optimizations
Frontend: Migrated from EJS templates to a React-based multi-page application using React Router. The frontend was refactored with React components, hooks, and context, leading to better state management, improved code modularity, and enhanced maintainability, providing a more dynamic and organized user experience.

Authentication: Replaced Passport.js with JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication, enabling stateless, token-based security that simplifies API management and enhances scalability.

Performance: Optimized rendering with React, leading to faster load times and improved responsiveness, significantly better than the previous EJS-based implementation.

Architecture: Separated the frontend and backend, allowing the React client to consume APIs from the backend, which enhances flexibility and maintainability for future updates.

## Lessons Learned
While optimizing Momentum, I strengthened my skills in React and modern authentication methods like JWT. I learned how to build scalable, secure systems using token-based authentication and improved my ability to handle API-based architectures. The switch from a template-based system (EJS) to a component-based system (React) has refined my approach to managing UI states and user interactions.
